Here are some notes:


1) BaseCharacter is the main character
2) BaseUnit is any other NPCs, could be Enemy or Villager
3) BaseProp is for environmental
4) BaseBuilding is for building itself.

Each time you want to add a new asset into the project,

Selected Base prefab > Create Prefab variant

This will retain the base properties and allows for easier changes in the future.
